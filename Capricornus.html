                The Greeks associated this constellation with the forest deity Pan. Pan was placed in the sky by Zeus in gratitude for his coming to the other gods' rescue on several occasions. </p>

                    In order to escape from the monster Typhon, Pan dived into a river and attempted to change himself into a fish. However, only the lower part of his body transformed, resulting in his half-goat half-fish depiction. Consequently, the name "Capricorn" which means "horned goat" in Latin.
